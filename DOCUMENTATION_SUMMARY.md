## 🎯 Key Features Documented

### Core Functionality

- **0ms latency impact** - Emphasized throughout documentation
- **AI-powered security** - Custom rules generated for each API
- **Real-time blocking** - Optional `blockRealtime` configuration
- **Express.js integration** - Simple middleware setup
- **Comprehensive analytics** - Security and performance metrics

### Configuration Options

- **apiKey** (required) - Authentication with KoruAI servers
- **appId** (required) - Application identifier
- **blockRealtime** (optional) - Enable real-time threat blocking

### 6-Step Process

1. **Create Account** → Sign up for KoruAI
2. **Create Application** → Get apiKey and appId credentials
3. **Install SDK** → `npm install koruai`
4. **Integrate Middleware** → Add KoruAI to Express.js app
5. **Generate Traffic** → Collect 100+ requests per endpoint
6. **Create Policies** → AI generates custom security rules
