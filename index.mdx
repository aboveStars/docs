## Why Choose KoruAI?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does KoruAI achieve 0ms latency?">
    KoruAI uses AI to generate specific static rules tailored to your API. This allows us to check each request for anomalies almost instantly, without the delays of traditional synchronous security processing. Your API performance remains unchanged while still receiving robust protection.
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="What makes it different from other security solutions?">
  Traditional security uses the same ruleset for every API, causing slowdowns
  (5-50ms latency) and false positives. KoruAI's AI learns your specific API
  behavior and creates custom rules with 0ms overhead and 99.9% accuracy for
  your unique endpoints.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly does the AI adapt to changes?">
    KoruAI's AI automatically detects new endpoints and begins learning their patterns immediately. Within minutes, your new endpoints have tailored protection without any manual configuration or security updates.
