Get your Express.js API secured with KoruAI in just a few minutes. Follow these 6 simple steps to start protecting your application with AI-powered security.

## Step 1: Create Your Account

First, you'll need to create a KoruAI account to get started.

1. Visit [KoruAI Dashboard](https://getkoru.ai/dashboard)
2. Click on **"Sign Up"** to create your account
3. Complete the registration process

  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  You can sign up using your email address or through GitHub/Google OAuth for
  faster registration.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create Your Application

Once logged in, you'll need to create an application to get your API credentials.

1. Navigate to your dashboard
2. Click **"Create New App"** button
3. Enter your application name
4. Click **"Create Application"**

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/placeholders/create-app.png"
    alt="Create Application Screenshot"
  />
</Frame>

After creation, you'll receive:

- **App ID**: Your unique application identifier
- **API Key**: Your authentication key for the KoruAI service

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code. Store it in
  environment variables.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Install the SDK

Install the KoruAI Express.js SDK in your project:

```bash
npm install koruai
```

<Tip>
  The KoruAI SDK is lightweight and has minimal dependencies to keep your
  application fast.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Integrate KoruAI into Your Express App

Add KoruAI middleware to your Express.js application:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Basic Integration
import express from "express";
import KoruAI from "koruai";

const app = express();

// Initialize KoruAI middleware
app.use(
  KoruAI({
    apiKey: process.env.KORUAI_API_KEY,
    appId: process.env.KORUAI_APP_ID,
  })
);

// Your existing routes
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  // Your application logic here
  res.json({ users: [] });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000 with KoruAI protection");
});
```

```javascript With Real-time Blocking
import express from "express";
import KoruAI from "koruai";

const app = express();

// Initialize KoruAI middleware with real-time blocking
app.use(
  KoruAI({
    apiKey: process.env.KORUAI_API_KEY,
    appId: process.env.KORUAI_APP_ID,
    blockRealtime: true, // Enable real-time threat blocking
  })
);

// Your existing routes
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ users: [] });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running with KoruAI real-time protection");
});
```

```bash Environment Variables
# Add to your .env file
KORUAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
KORUAI_APP_ID=your-app-id-here
```

</CodeGroup>

### Configuration Options

<ParamField path="apiKey" type="string" required>
  Your KoruAI API key for authentication
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="appId" type="string" required>
  Your application ID from the KoruAI dashboard
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="blockRealtime" type="boolean" default="false">
  Enable real-time blocking of suspicious requests. When `true`, KoruAI will
  automatically block requests that match threat patterns.
</ParamField>

## Step 5: Generate Traffic for Analysis

KoruAI needs to analyze your API traffic patterns to create effective security rules.

1. Deploy your application with KoruAI integrated
2. Generate normal user traffic to your API endpoints
3. Wait for sufficient requests to be collected (recommended: 100+ requests per endpoint)

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/placeholders/traffic-analysis.png"
    alt="Traffic Analysis Dashboard"
  />
</Frame>

<Info>
  **How much traffic do I need?** KoruAI works best with at least 100 requests
  per endpoint. The more diverse and realistic traffic you have, the better the
  AI can understand your API patterns and create accurate security rules.
</Info>

### Monitor Your Traffic

You can monitor incoming requests in your KoruAI dashboard:

- **Total Requests**: Number of requests processed
- **Unique Endpoints**: API endpoints discovered
- **Request Patterns**: Traffic patterns being learned

## Step 6: Create Security Policies

Once you have sufficient traffic data, create AI-powered security policies:

1. Go to your application dashboard
2. Navigate to the **"Policies"** section
3. Click **"Create Policies"** button
4. Wait for the AI to analyze your traffic and generate custom rules

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/placeholders/create-policies.png"
    alt="Create Policies Screenshot"
  />
</Frame>

The policy creation process includes:

- **Traffic Analysis**: AI analyzes your request patterns
- **Rule Generation**: Custom security rules are created for your specific API
- **Validation**: Rules are tested against your traffic patterns
- **Deployment**: Active protection begins

<Success>
  ðŸŽ‰ **You're all set!** Your Express.js application is now protected by
  KoruAI's AI-powered security with 0ms latency impact.
</Success>

## What Happens Next?

Once your policies are active, KoruAI will:

âœ… **Monitor all incoming requests** with zero performance impact  
âœ… **Detect anomalous behavior** using your custom AI rules  
âœ… **Block suspicious requests** (if `blockRealtime` is enabled)  
âœ… **Provide detailed analytics** in your dashboard  
âœ… **Automatically adapt** to new endpoints and patterns

## Verification

To verify everything is working correctly:

1. Check your dashboard for incoming request data
2. Look for the policy creation status
3. Monitor the analytics for any detected anomalies

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My policies aren't being created">
    Make sure you have sufficient traffic (100+ requests recommended). Check that your API key and App ID are correct, and verify that requests are showing up in your dashboard.
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="I'm seeing authentication errors">
  Double-check your API key and App ID in your environment variables. Make sure
  they match exactly what's shown in your KoruAI dashboard.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real-time blocking isn't working">
    Ensure you've set `blockRealtime: true` in your KoruAI configuration and that you have active policies created for your endpoints.
  </Accordion>
